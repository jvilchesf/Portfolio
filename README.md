### Supervised Learning Section

Classification Models:
- **Decision Trees**: Include a project where you used a decision tree model. Provide details on the dataset, problem statement, and results.
- **Random Forest Classification**: Showcase a project using a random forest classifier, explaining how it improved over a simpler model like decision trees.

### Unsupervised Learning Section

Clustering Models:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Present a project where you implemented k-means clustering. Explain the dataset, preprocessing steps, and insights gained from the clusters.

### Regression Models Section

One Variable Regression:
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Include a project where you applied simple linear regression. Discuss the context, data, model fit, and interpretation of results.

Multiple Variable Regression:
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Showcase a project with multiple linear regression, detailing the use of multiple predictors and the modelâ€™s performance.

### A/B Testing Section

A/B Testing:
- **Experiment Design**: Present an A/B testing project, describing the hypothesis, experiment setup, data collection, and results.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Explain the statistical tests used and how you interpreted the results to make decisions.

### Additional Projects Section
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Showcase projects where you performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Include projects that highlight your ability to conduct thorough EDA to uncover insights and inform modeling choices.
- **Visualization**: Demonstrate your ability to create insightful and impactful visualizations using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
